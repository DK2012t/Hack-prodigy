1. Bookmark: `javascript:with(console){log=dir=clear=()=>{}}` (Remember, it’s the bookmarklet.)

Make a bookmark, and copy paste the javascript into the "URL" field. Now press the bookmarklet to run the code. You should now be able to
open console.

2. Second script: `{Boot}`

    2a) Click on `{Boot: ƒ}`

    2b) Click on `[[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]`

    2c) Right click on `1: Closure {e: {…}, s: Module, r: {…}, h: {…}, n: ƒ, …}`

    2d) Click on `Store as global variable`

    It should now say "Closure", and "temp1". Make sure you follow these steps EXACTLY, or the hacks won't work!

Now that you've done this, you can now run the rest of the prodigy hacks! Currently only a select few of our hacks has been updated.
