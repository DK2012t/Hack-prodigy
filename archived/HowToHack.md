# How to bypass Anti-Cheat (as of 4/24/2020)

## YOU CANNOT HACK ON MOBILE DEVICES.

### Note: Only tested with GOOGLE CHROME on PC. We cannot promise the steps to hack will be the same on any other setup.

---

### This method is SEVERELY OUTDATED, and does not have any hacks made for this method.

You should only use this method if you have to. There are no hacks made for this method, but it shouldn't be too hard to modify hacks.

In most instances, in all the hacks you see, replace `hack.instance` with `temp1.object.a.a.instance`.
Anything else is unsupported.

1. Bookmark: `javascript:with(console){log=dir=clear=()=>{}}` (Remember, it’s the bookmarklet.)

Make a bookmark, and copy paste the javascript into the "URL" field. Now press the bookmarklet to run the code. You should now be able to
open console.

2. Second script: `{Boot}`

    2a) Click on `{Boot: ƒ}`

    2b) Click on `[[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]`

    2c) Right click on `1: Closure {e: {…}, s: Module, r: {…}, h: {…}, n: ƒ, …}`

    2d) Click on `Store as global variable`

    It should now say "Closure", and "temp1". Make sure you follow these steps EXACTLY, or the hacks won't work!
`
Now that you've done this, you can now run the rest of the prodigy hacks! Currently only a select few of our hacks has been updated.
If you want hacks, just ask us!

### List of currently updated hacks

None. I'll give you one last bit of help, then you're on your own, cowboy.

```javascript
temp1.object.a.a.instance.prodigy //contains the prodigy object

temp1.object.a.a.instance.prodigy.player.it //membership boolean

temp1.object.a.a.instance.prodigy.player.data //data object
```
