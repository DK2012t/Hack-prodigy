Whats the point of this:

I wanted to make a cheat menu, however i know Wills is already god tier, so i needed to do something special with this.
Thats why its an MASTER cheat menu, it has way more hacks than Wills.

How long until its done:

I will be updating this for a long time, however until it becomes useable, I would say a couple weeks.

Is this better than Wills Cheat Menu:

No.

Why would I use this:

If you want a hack, but you dont see it on Wills Cheat Menu, chances are its on here.

Is this hard to use:

On your eyes, yes, on your mind, no.

Can you make it have a dropdown menu instead of closeing it:

Yes, im working on it.
