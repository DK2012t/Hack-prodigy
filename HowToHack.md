1) Convert this to a bookmarklet: `with(console){log=dir=clear=()=>{}}` (Remember, it’s the bookmarklet.)

Make a bookmarklet, and then click it to run the Javascript within. Doing this should allow you to open the Developer Console.


2) Second script: `{Boot}`

    2a) Click on `{Boot: ƒ}`
    
    2b) Click on `[[Scopes]]: Scopes[4]`
    
    2c) Right click on `1: Closure {e: {…}, s: Module, r: {…}, h: {…}, n: ƒ, …}`
    
    2d) Click on `Store as global variable`
    
    It should now say "Closure", and "temp1". Make sure you follow these steps EXACTLY, or the hacks won't work!
Use the [Bookmarklet maker](https://caiorss.github.io/bookmarklet-maker/) to make bookmarklets.

Now that you've done this, you can now run the rest of the prodigy hacks! Currently only a select few of our hacks has been updated.
If you want hacks, just ask us!
