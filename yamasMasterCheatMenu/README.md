# Yama's Master Cheat Menu
To use this hack menu, simply go to the "Bookmarklet" file, make it a bookmarklet, and click it! Or just copy and paste the raw script from the file "Hack Menu Script(Important!)"

Make sure that the Will's Cheat Menu dropwdown is DOWN, meaning that you can see the hacks from it. This lets you put in the Master Cheat Menu without a problem!

If somethings wrong with the cheat menu, either DM me on discord(Yama#5821) or join our discord and make a bug report.
