### We are NOT trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game.

This may look like we're trying to ruin the game, but we're helping make it better. By finding exploits, we help the developers find that there is an exploit, and the developers fix it, overall helping the game. Anyone who claims that we are 'malicious' or 'ruining the game', are wrong. Please don't spread misinformation.

## The Purpose of Hacking Prodigy, the Math Game

We're making this repository to try to get the developers to change how Prodigy handles player game data. Instead of handling everything server side, a lot of the heavy lifting is done on the player side. The server just manages multiplayer battles, and hosts data, messages, and events.

Since we've hacked prodigy, there have been many anti-cheat updates. Go, devs!
