## Disclaimers
- All hacks, exploits, or other files hosted here may damage your account. Do not use *any* of these hacks on your primary account, as you risk your account becoming damaged beyond repair, preventing you from accessing Prodigy Math Game in that account. You have been warned.
   
- We are not liable for any damages of any kind, as our license states:
> 7. Limitation of Liability
>    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from such partyâ€™s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

## The Purpose of Hacking Prodigy, the Math Game
We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored all of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. We created this repository to show them the security issues directly.

### We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game.
This may look like we're trying to ruin the game, but we're helping make it better. By finding exploits, we help the developers find that there is an exploit, and the developers fix it, overall helping the game. Anyone who claims that we are 'malicious' or 'ruining the game', are wrong. Please don't spread misinformation.
