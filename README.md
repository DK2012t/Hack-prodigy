# Hacking Prodigy, the Math Game

I'm making this repository to try to get the developers to change how Prodigy handles player game data. Instead of handling everything server side, a lot of the heavy lifting is done on the player side. The server just manages multiplayer battles, and hosts data, messages, and events.

Basically any changes you make to PIXI.game.prodigy.player will save. Be warned, if you mess up the data TOO much, the server gets really confused, and your account is broken forever! Don't do this on your main account. I've already broken three accounts. ;)

# Disclaimer
THESE HACKS MAY OR MAY NOT BREAK YOUR ACCOUNT. DO NOT USE ANY OF THESE HACKS ON YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT, OR YOU MAY RISK YOUR ACCOUNT BECOMING IRREPERABLY BUGGED OUT, PREVENTING YOU FROM PLAYING THE GAME USING THAT ACCOUNT.
You have been warned.
