# ProdigyMathGameHacking

## Purpose
We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored all of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. We created this repository to show them the security issues directly.

## Hack instructions
- **[Redirect Hack](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/wiki/Redirect-Hack)**
- **[Locally Host Redirect Hack](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/redirect/README.md)** (Advanced)

## Announcements
- `7/11/2020` - We have re-gained access to our email. Thank you for the patience.
- `7/5/2020` - Thank you for everyone that has supported us by using our exploits/hacks. However, our goal isn't to ruin Prodigy, it's to patch these hacks, and we need your help! If you can go on Prodigy's Twitter and Instagram and ask them to patch [this Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redirector/ocgpenflpmgnfapjedencafcfakcekcd?hl=en) that allows us to change their files it would be great! 
- `7/1/2020` - Check out our [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChIRMY6SdQrcADVscWTVv9A)!
- `6/10/2020` - Another extension is now required to use the hacks. Download [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/always-disable-content-se/ffelghdomoehpceihalcnbmnodohkibj/). If that extension doesn't work for you, try [this one](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ignore-x-frame-headers/gleekbfjekiniecknbkamfmkohkpodhe?hl=en-US)

## Disclaimers
- All hacks, exploits, or other files hosted here may damage your account if used improperly or excessively. Do not use *any* of these hacks on your primary account, as you risk your account becoming damaged beyond repair, preventing you from accessing Prodigy Math Game in that account. You have been warned.
   
- We are not liable for any damages of any kind, as our license states:
> 7. Limitation of Liability
>    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.

### We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game.
This may look like we're trying to ruin the game, but we're helping make it better. By finding exploits, we help the developers find that there is an exploit, and the developers fix it, overall helping the game. Anyone who claims that we are 'malicious' or 'ruining the game', are wrong. Please don't spread misinformation.
