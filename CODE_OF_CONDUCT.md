# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose (This doesn't have anything to do with our hacking standards)

We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored *all* of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. Therefore, we have created this Code of Conduct.

## Hacking code of conduct (Please read this)

### Under NO circumstances should ANYBODY be using these hacks to cicumvent privacy of other users, use explicits within the game, phish, gain access to other accounts without autorization from the original account user, or go against our goals.

#### You MUST NOT USE **ANY** OF THE HACKS TO ACHIEVE PERSONAL BENEFIT, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

- Money
- Currencies
- Subscribers/Views on YouTube
- Twitter/Facebook/Instagram followers

#### FAILING TO FOLLOW OUR TERMS WILL RESULT IN LEGAL ACTION

## Thank you for honoring our wishes!
