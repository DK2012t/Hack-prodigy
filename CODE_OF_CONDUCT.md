# Citizen Code of Conduct

## Purpose (This doesn't have anything to do with our hacking standards)

We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored *all* of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. Therefore, we have created this Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct

### Under NO circumstances should ANYBODY use these hacks to cicrumvent the privacy of other users, use explicits within the game, phish, gain access to other accounts without autorization from the original account user, or otherwise go against our purpose.

#### You must not use **any** of the hacks to achieve personal benefit, including but not limited to:
- Currencies
- Subscribers/Views on YouTube
- Twitter/Facebook/Instagram followers

**If you are going to make a video on these hacks, please give credit in the form provided here [here](https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/videocredit.md).**

#### FAILING TO FOLLOW OUR TERMS WILL RESULT IN LEGAL ACTION
